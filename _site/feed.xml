        <title>Accounting Overview</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Accounting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various organizations defined Accounting to provide a better understanding of its nature and function. And one of the most notable definitions, as published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least of financial character, and interpreting the results thereof.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us dissect this definition into four parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art of recording, classifying, and summarizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting involves the step-by-step process of recording transactions, classifying transactions of similar and dissimilar nature into accounts, and summarizing accounts into reports. All of these is an art because it involves the use of creative and professional judgment by the preparers throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;1.2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant manner and in terms of money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting provides reports to users in a meaningful way to be more useful. Yet, different users have different needs and preparing different reports is impractical. As a solution, in financial accounting “general purpose financial statements” are prepared which provides not all information but the common needs of different users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;1.3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transactions and events which are in part at least of financial character&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transactions are accounted if they are of financial value or when it affects the resources of an entity and claims against resources. Financial statements present quantitative information but not qualitative information while financial reports include both information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;1.4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpreting the results &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting does not end after the preparation of reports but also interprets and communicates the information to guide users in making decisions. Interpretation is achieved by financial statement analysis. This aspect of accounting is also one of the reasons why accounting is an art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accounting vs Bookkeeping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bookkeeping or Recordkeeping is the process of recording day-to-day activities of an entity. It is the part of accounting that focuses on storing data by recording past transactions through journalizing and posting. Accounting is a much broader function as it encompasses not only recording but also interpreting and communicating summarized transactions to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are a vital part of accounting as accounting is based on the users’ needs. Accounting information is prepared to meet the users’ needs especially to aide in the decision-making process. These users are classified into two, the External and Internal Users. External users are decision-makers that do not have full access to the company’s records. They are parties outside the company’s decision-making function. Internal Users, on the other hand, are part of the company giving them the capacity to fully access the company’s records and other business activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;4.1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial accounting is the area of accounting that focuses on the needs of external users by preparing “Financial Statements.” Financial accounting is governed by standards called GAAP – Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Because external users wish to see the same information as much as the internal users do, financial statements must follow the GAAP as the law of accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;4.2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managerial Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managerial accounting is the area of accounting that provides information to internal users. In contrast to Financial accounting, Managerial accounting does not have a set of standards and is more concerned with future activities. Standards in reporting do not apply to management accounting because the information is tailored to the company’s decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;4.3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Auditing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of auditing is to provide opinion on the fairness of assertion by an entity. It involves the independent check of external auditors about the preparation of financial statements in accordance with standards. Auditing starts when financial accounting ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;4.4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax accounting is the preparation of income tax returns and other tax requirements to the Bureau of Internal Revenue following the National Internal Revenue Code as amended by the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;4.5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government Accounting &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Accounting encompasses the processes of analyzing, recording, classifying, summarizing and communicating all transactions involving the receipt and disposition of government funds and property, and interpreting the results thereof. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Sectors of Accounting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commerce and Industry&lt;/strong&gt; is the sector of accounting wherein an individual with the necessary skills and competence is employed by an entity as an accountant. Accountants in commerce and industry typically perform financial accounting, managerial accounting, tax accounting, and internal auditing. Being a CPA is not a qualification to be a private accountant as long the employer hires that individual but, having a CPA license increases the chance of passing an employment application. Because of this lower qualifications, commerce and industry is the largest sector of accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Accounting&lt;/strong&gt; – is the sector that provides accounting, auditing, and other related services to different clients or the public. Anyone can hire the services of a public accountant to conduct accounting related services at a reasonable engagement price. Meaning, public accountants do not serve single employer but various clients, usually businesses.  Services offered may include financial accounting, external auditing, tax accounting, management advisory services, forensic accounting and more. To provide the best services to the public, public accountants must be a licensed CPA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government Accounting&lt;/strong&gt; – is the practice as an accountant in local government, national government or in government-owned and or controlled corporations. To be a government employee, an individual must pass the civil service eligibility exam but board licenses such as the CPA license serve as second-level eligibility. Therefore, accountants in government are usually licensed CPAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academe&lt;/strong&gt; – the sector wherein an accountant, as part of an educational institution, teaches accounting, auditing, management advisory services, accounting aspects of finance, business law, taxation, and other technically related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don’t Hire Digital Marketing Agencies — 9 Reasons Why</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Heard of these marketing agencies existing decades ago? Of course, marketing agencies are already in business a long time ago. But what I will be talking about here right now are the digital marketing agencies. And the real question is, do you really need them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I’m not against the digital marketing agency business model. In fact, I love them and I think most of them are doing a great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s with the pessimistic title? Well, most digital marketing agencies are really good. They could produce results more than you could expect. But most of the time, the reason why you mustn’t be hiring them involves factors surrounding your business! Maybe, marketing agency services don’t suit your business well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 9 reasons why your business don’t need or not ready to embrace the services of a digital marketing agency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no guarantee you’ll produce a return&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t mean otherwise when you decided to build in-house marketing team. The problem that I’m trying to point out is your expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any investment brings with it risks. We’ll double your income.. they say. We’ll help you grow your business.. they say. All of these assertions may be true. But if they can double your income, surely, they can also double your loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you happened to stumble upon a digital marketing agency that claims to guarantee a return, run away fast! There’s no guarantee.. never in earth’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re not knowledgeable enough to make sound decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an owner of a business, no matter how big or small it is, you must understand the implication of outsourcing your business’ digital marketing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s practically no different from hiring employees for your business. When you hire an employee, you primarily want to know how good they will be. That will be the same for hiring a digital marketing agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have no idea about the services they provide, don’t just rush in and rely in their words. You must first educate yourself. Research the technical terms. Research what value could it possibly bring to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing business becomes harder to manage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think you could lie all day in a couch when your business is booming, then think again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re growing exponentially. You established so many relationships. And in a single mismanaged product or service, negative reviews kept pouring regarding how bad it is. This is tarnishing your reputation when there are already so many people seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your products simply suck!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before hiring a digital marketing agency, make sure you have solid products. No matter how good the agency is, when your clients and customers are seeing garbage, you won’t make a sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, you should have improved your products by getting customers’ feedback. But how could I acquire customer feedback when I don’t have customers because I don’t do marketing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t say you don’t do marketing. You could market without an agency. And also you could acquire feedback from friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources supposedly spent for an agency should first be spent for product improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your website hasn’t been updated for a decade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t even view it nicely in a mobile device. Mobile friendliness is an integral part of search engine optimization (SEO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your website doesn’t have many contents, it won’t be too much of a problem. Most of the digital marketing agencies are also web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem will be is the migration of your data if your previous website contains a lot of information. As well as, it is very complicated. It also turns out that your chosen digital marketing agency don’t know how to properly migrate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will leave you to two choices. Hire a web developer who can do the job and incur additional cost. Or proceed with the old website (this won’t be a good idea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are not comfortable sharing your business information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You aren’t comfortable sharing business information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these agencies will ask about your long-term and short-term objects, your current revenue, your expected revenue increase after acquiring their service, historical data on past marketing campaigns, your vision mission, and also your brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you wholeheartedly give the digital marketing agencies these information, they can’t bring out the best in your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are hesitant, and you value more the confidentiality of your information by some certain reasons, then you might not consider hiring one because it may cost you more than reaping benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget constraint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply don’t have the budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to the point you could hire employees to take on slots in your marketing department, you must also consider hiring marketing agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the fact is, hiring these agencies cost less than hiring a complete team of full-time marketing employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes, a freelancer is enough to get it done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have the budget. But sometimes your goals might be more efficiently achieved by hiring a freelancer, not a whole marketing agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, hiring a competent freelancer is easier. You can always check out freelancer sites such as Fiverr and Upwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of hiring freelancers of course is they cost less. And sometimes produces better results than an agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t have clear goals.. yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before hiring an agency, you must have crystal clear goals in mind. This helps you assess if investing in marketing is worthwhile for your business. Also, you can assess the performance of the agency to be a basis if you’ll still be working with them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Marketing is but a part of marketing as a whole — but a significant one this days. In order to be bring out the most value in your investment, you should always consider different factors surrounding your business. You could hire the best agency out there but it is still you who gets to decide whether your business will be successful or not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What is Business?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IFRS Foundation defined &lt;strong&gt;Business&lt;/strong&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simpler words, a business is an organization that provides goods or services, or both, intending to make a profit. Although some view profit-making as abuse, the economy also receives benefits from businesses such as having easy access to services and products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business entities are classified into three main types according to their nature of activities. It can be a service business, a merchandising business, or a manufacturing business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;2.1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Provider&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A service business is a type of business where a company provides services or entertainment to customers without transferring tangible products while a merchandising and manufacturing business are companies that transfer goods to customers. A business is not just about the product, it can also run by providing services such as talent studios that provide entertainment to viewers and money safekeeping and security services by banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;2.2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merchandising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A business that transfers goods to customers is either a merchandising or manufacturing entity. The difference between merchandising and manufacturing is that a &lt;strong&gt;Merchandising business&lt;/strong&gt; provides goods to customers bought from suppliers with little or no process applied, meaning goods are sold on the same state as when it was purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;2.3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing business&lt;/strong&gt; is a business that processes raw materials into finished products that are eventually sold to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business structure or legal structure of business differs from country to country. For instance, in the US it falls under 5 types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sole Proprietorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S Corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited Liability Company (LLC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it important to choose the right business structure? Each structure actually has its pros and cons. This highly affects your taxes and the amount of liability. In order to choose the right structure, you must know your business very well. Also, choosing the right business structure must be included in your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take note that these 5 types of business structures may not be the case in your country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;3.1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sole Proprietorship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the easiest and simplest to form. This type usually is recommended for beginner entrepreneurs who intend to work alone and solo the profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to form&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You solo the profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal legal requirements to comply for&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can decide alone for your business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You usually need a small capital to form one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harder funding &amp;ndash; you usually start with your own funds (you can&amp;rsquo;t easily obtain a large amount of loan from banks with this kind of structure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s harder to fund this type of structure, it also generally yields the lowest amount of profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your personal properties are not protected. For instance, your business went bankrupt, your unpaid creditors may file a suit against your personal properties (e.g. your car, or house, or lot may be attached and executed by the court in payment to your creditor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;3.2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to form a business together with your friends or family members, this type may work out for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to form just like sole proprietorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally lower taxes than a corporation. However, some countries tax partnerships as if they are corporations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are a limited partner in a limited partnership, your personal properties are protected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally higher profit compared to a sole proprietorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher chance of acquiring funds compared to a sole proprietorship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal legal requirements compared to corporations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A partnership is easily dissolved &amp;ndash; the death, insanity, or civil interdiction of a partner usually will automatically result in the dissolution of a partnership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Company is usually managed by many persons and may result to conflicts in decision-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two kinds of partnerships: 1.) General Partnership &amp;ndash; composed of general partners; and 2.) Limited Partnership &amp;ndash; composed of at least 1 general partners and the remaining are limited partners. General partners&amp;rsquo; personal properties are not protected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;3.3&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is usually referred to as C Corporation. If you want to establish a really big business requiring high funding, a corporation is the structure for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, generates the largest profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to acquire large funds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a right of succession &amp;ndash; meaning the death of a stockholder will not dissolve the corporation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Usually has a more organized decision-making body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protection of personal properties &amp;ndash; any stockholder&amp;rsquo;s personal property is protected under a corporate structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy taxation &amp;ndash; generally double taxation is imposed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tons of legal requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavily regulated by-laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large capital requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;3.4&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S Corporation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This a type of corporation. It is actually similar aspects from a C Corporation except for the following pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May use the cash method of accounting as opposed to GAAP&amp;rsquo;s accrual method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited to 100 shareholders only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All shareholders must be US citizens (since this post is based on US business laws and tax laws)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 id=&quot;3.5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Liability Company (LLC)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of business structure is like a combination of a partnership and a corporation. It may also sound like an S corporation but there are differences which are mentioned in the pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not limited to any number of members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited to certain types of business (e.g. most states generally do not allow banks and insurance companies to form LLC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;What is AIS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;This is a system that captures certain data for the creation of financial reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;What is a system?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are interrelated things that work together in order to achieve a certain objective/s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;What type of data does AIS capture?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial data such as those produced by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;investments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;loans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and many more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5&quot;&gt;What are financial reports?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial reports (or specifically financial statements) are formal records of a business' financial activities and position. The way financial reports are created and structured is generally in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;6&quot;&gt;What are the elements or components of an AIS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT Infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set of procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;7&quot;&gt;How can an AIS add value to businesses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvement of products and services&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
