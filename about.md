	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Us</h1>
	<p>Akawnting is an educational endeavor which aims to help aspiring students reach their dreams. Our mission is to provide valuable enhancement to formal education by creating online contents and resources. This way, student learning is not limited to the four walls of the classroom. We, having CPA founders, initially plan to create accounting courses to show appreciation and gratitude towards the field. However, we envision to be a leader in online education which expands beyond accounting and business.</p>
	<p>Akawnting.com is dedicated to providing ABM students, business students, reviewees, aspiring CPAs, and even business persons wanting to learn accounting the necessary knowledge and resources.</p>
	<p>We understand that in order to cope up with the ever changing landscape of the business and finance field, you need to be updated in various frameworks, standards, and most importantly technologies that have significant impact on the field.</p>
	<p>We will be providing and will continuously improve free courses bundled with amazing lectures, comprehensive questions and solutions, slide presentations, video lessons, and many more. </p>
