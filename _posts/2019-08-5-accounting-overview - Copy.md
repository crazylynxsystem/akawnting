<h2 id="1"><strong>What is Accounting?</strong></h2>
<p>Various organizations defined Accounting to provide a better understanding of its nature and function. And one of the most notable definitions, as published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), is as follows:</p>
<p>“the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least of financial character, and interpreting the results thereof.”</p>
<p>Let us dissect this definition into four parts.</p>
<ol>
<li><h3 id="1.1"><strong>Art of recording, classifying, and summarizing</strong></h3></li>
<p>Accounting involves the step-by-step process of recording transactions, classifying transactions of similar and dissimilar nature into accounts, and summarizing accounts into reports. All of these is an art because it involves the use of creative and professional judgment by the preparers throughout the process.</p>
<li><h3 id="1.2"><strong>Significant manner and in terms of money</strong></h3></li>
<p>Accounting provides reports to users in a meaningful way to be more useful. Yet, different users have different needs and preparing different reports is impractical. As a solution, in financial accounting “general purpose financial statements” are prepared which provides not all information but the common needs of different users.</p>
<li><h3 id="1.3"><strong>Transactions and events which are in part at least of financial character</strong></h3></li>
<p>Transactions are accounted if they are of financial value or when it affects the resources of an entity and claims against resources. Financial statements present quantitative information but not qualitative information while financial reports include both information.</p>
<li><h3 id="1.4"><strong>Interpreting the results </strong></h3></li>
<p>Accounting does not end after the preparation of reports but also interprets and communicates the information to guide users in making decisions. Interpretation is achieved by financial statement analysis. This aspect of accounting is also one of the reasons why accounting is an art.</p>
</ol>
<h2 id="2"><strong>Accounting vs Bookkeeping</strong></h2>
<p>Bookkeeping or Recordkeeping is the process of recording day-to-day activities of an entity. It is the part of accounting that focuses on storing data by recording past transactions through journalizing and posting. Accounting is a much broader function as it encompasses not only recording but also interpreting and communicating summarized transactions to users.</p>
<h2 id="3"><strong>Users</strong></h2>
<p>Users are a vital part of accounting as accounting is based on the users’ needs. Accounting information is prepared to meet the users’ needs especially to aide in the decision-making process. These users are classified into two, the External and Internal Users. External users are decision-makers that do not have full access to the company’s records. They are parties outside the company’s decision-making function. Internal Users, on the other hand, are part of the company giving them the capacity to fully access the company’s records and other business activities.</p>
<h2 id="4"><strong>Types of Accounting</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><h3 id="4.1"><strong>Financial Accounting</strong></h3></li>
<p>Financial accounting is the area of accounting that focuses on the needs of external users by preparing “Financial Statements.” Financial accounting is governed by standards called GAAP – Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Because external users wish to see the same information as much as the internal users do, financial statements must follow the GAAP as the law of accounting.</p>
<li><h3 id="4.2"><strong>Managerial Accounting</strong></h3></li>
<p>Managerial accounting is the area of accounting that provides information to internal users. In contrast to Financial accounting, Managerial accounting does not have a set of standards and is more concerned with future activities. Standards in reporting do not apply to management accounting because the information is tailored to the company’s decision-makers.</p>
<li><h3 id="4.3"><strong>External Auditing</strong></h3></li>
<p>The purpose of auditing is to provide opinion on the fairness of assertion by an entity. It involves the independent check of external auditors about the preparation of financial statements in accordance with standards. Auditing starts when financial accounting ends.</p>
<li><h3 id="4.4"><strong>Tax Accounting</strong></h3></li>
<p>Tax accounting is the preparation of income tax returns and other tax requirements to the Bureau of Internal Revenue following the National Internal Revenue Code as amended by the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion.</p>
<li><h3 id="4.5"><strong>Government Accounting </strong></h3></li>
<p>Government Accounting encompasses the processes of analyzing, recording, classifying, summarizing and communicating all transactions involving the receipt and disposition of government funds and property, and interpreting the results thereof. </p>
</ol>
<h2 id="5"><strong>4 Sectors of Accounting</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Commerce and Industry</strong> is the sector of accounting wherein an individual with the necessary skills and competence is employed by an entity as an accountant. Accountants in commerce and industry typically perform financial accounting, managerial accounting, tax accounting, and internal auditing. Being a CPA is not a qualification to be a private accountant as long the employer hires that individual but, having a CPA license increases the chance of passing an employment application. Because of this lower qualifications, commerce and industry is the largest sector of accounting.</p>
<p><strong>Public Accounting</strong> – is the sector that provides accounting, auditing, and other related services to different clients or the public. Anyone can hire the services of a public accountant to conduct accounting related services at a reasonable engagement price. Meaning, public accountants do not serve single employer but various clients, usually businesses.  Services offered may include financial accounting, external auditing, tax accounting, management advisory services, forensic accounting and more. To provide the best services to the public, public accountants must be a licensed CPA. </p>
<p><strong>Government Accounting</strong> – is the practice as an accountant in local government, national government or in government-owned and or controlled corporations. To be a government employee, an individual must pass the civil service eligibility exam but board licenses such as the CPA license serve as second-level eligibility. Therefore, accountants in government are usually licensed CPAs. </p>
<p><strong>Academe</strong> – the sector wherein an accountant, as part of an educational institution, teaches accounting, auditing, management advisory services, accounting aspects of finance, business law, taxation, and other technically related subjects.</p>
